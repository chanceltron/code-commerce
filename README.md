# React Project - Code Commerce

You are going to build an e-commerce store for code. A super-smart person decided it was time for developers to actually make money with code instead of posting it for free online. Introducing Code Commerce -- a store where developers can sell pre-built code projects and snippets.

üîç This project focuses on a few major principles:

Forms and form validation with React
Building stateful components
Passing data between components

üõ† Requirements:
You will build a 5-part checkout form.

Signup/Login
Customer cart
Shipping information
Payment information
Confirmation
Must include the "progress bar" as shown in the SHIPPING & PAYMENT mockup below.
Note: Please do NOT use React Routing in this project. You will learn about it later. The goal is to master components, props, state and conditional UI rendering.

### üõ† Shipping Information

User can sign-in
Password field is obscured
There is an "eye" icon next to password to reveal what is being typed
If password is invalid, show an error message as depicted in the screenshot below
